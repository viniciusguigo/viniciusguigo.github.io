# Vision-based Detection of Unmanned Air Systems for Counter-UAS
![LWIR+RGB Drone Detection](../images/drone_detection.png)

This research was winner of the 2020 SPIE Automatic Target Recognition Best Student Paper Award. It combines data from RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras to detect drones through previously difficult environments such as flying above and below the treeline/horizon, in the presence of birds, and glare from the sun.
