Hi and welcome to my webpage!

Iâ€™m a machine learning researcher and engineer designing novel machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms that learn from (inherently noisy and ambiguous) human feedback. I'm also building [machine learning-based software tools](https://www.cmidas.com/) to make individual traders more confident when investing their money.  

Please feel free to reach out via email (vinicius.goecks [at] gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vggoecks/). Thanks for visiting!
