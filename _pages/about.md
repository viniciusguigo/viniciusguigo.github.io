Hi and welcome to my webpage!

My name is Vinicius, I have recently completed my doctoral degree with a dissertation on “Human-in-the-loop Methods for Data-driven and Reinforcement Learning Systems” at Texas A&M University.

Most of my recent research work is on [human-in-the-loop machine learning](/research/#human-in-the-loop-machine-learning), where artificially intelligent agents learn new behaviors in real-time by interacting with humans, which. This includes using multimodal human data, such as eye gaze and natural language, to train learning agents via supervised and reinforcement learning. I also work on [computer vision](/research/#vision-based-detection-of-unmanned-air-systems-for-counter-uas), specifically machine learning-based video object tracking and how to improve it by augmenting the traditional visible-spectrum tracking with long-wave infrared. Finally, I have previously worked on [space robotics, estimation, and control](/research/#enabling-deep-space-exploration-with-an-in-space-propellant-depot-supplied-from-lunar-ice). In my spare time, I enjoy understanding how these topics interact with themselves, how they relate to complexity theory, and how they apply to system dynamics and time-series forecasting.

If you are interested in talking more about related research, please reach me out at vinicius.goecks[at]gmail.com, or via LinkedIn and ResearchGate, for which you can find the links at the sidebar of my homepage.

Thanks for visiting!
