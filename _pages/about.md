Hi and welcome to my webpage!

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at U.S. Army Research Laboratory developing algorithms to enable collaboration between humans and artificially intelligent robotic agents. I have recently completed my doctoral degree with a dissertation on “Human-in-the-loop Methods for Data-driven and Reinforcement Learning Systems” at Texas A&M University advised by Dr. John Valasek.

Most of my recent research work is on [human-in-the-loop machine learning](/ai/), where artificially intelligent agents learn new behaviors in real-time by interacting with humans. This includes using multimodal human input modalities, such as eye gaze and natural language, to train learning agents via supervised and reinforcement learning, and learning a common shared-world representation that can be used concurrently by both humans and robotics agents for coordinated planning. I also work on [computer vision](/counter-uas/), specifically machine learning-based video object detection and tracking, and how to improve it by augmenting the traditional visible-spectrum tracking with long-wave infrared. Finally, I have previously worked on [space robotics, estimation, and control](/robotics/). In my spare time, I enjoy understanding how to model time-series and aplly them to [market forecasting and financial modeling](https://cmidas.com).

If you are interested in talking more about [related research](/research/), please reach me out at vinicius.goecks [at] gmail.com, or via LinkedIn and ResearchGate, for which you can find the links at the sidebar of this webpage.

Thanks for visiting!
