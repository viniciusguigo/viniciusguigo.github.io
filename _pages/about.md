Hi and welcome to my webpage!

I'm a machine learning researcher who designs novel algorithms that learn from human interaction. Currently, my research focuses on developing machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms that leverage large language models as a natural interface between humans and data-driven systems. Specifically, I'm interested in how these algorithms can be used to improve communication and decision-making in scenarios where humans and machines need to work together.

You can explore my research on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zRD7VRUAAAAJ&hl=en) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vggoecks/). If you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free to email me at vinicius.goecks@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by!
