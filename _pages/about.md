Hi and welcome to my webpage!

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory designing, implementing, and evaluating novel machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms that learn from (inherently noisy and ambiguous) human feedback. I also maintain a machine learning-based web app that models and forecasts financial markets in real-time for [quantitative trading](https://www.cmidas.com/dashboard/).

Please feel free to reach out via email (vinicius.goecks [at] gmail.com), LinkedIn, or ResearchGate following the links at the sidebar of this webpage.

Thanks for visiting!
