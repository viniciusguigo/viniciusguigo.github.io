Postdoctoral Fellow at the CCDC Army Research Laboratory, Human Research and Engineering Directorate.

My research comprises developing novel machine learning algorithms for human-machine interaction, computer-vision algorithms for object detection, and how to leverage them to improve and control autonomous systems. Also play with time-series and financial data on my free time.
